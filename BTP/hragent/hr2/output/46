Post-Doctoral Career 
Caltech Postdoctoral Scholar, (08/2011-) 
  Role of Comet and Asteroid Observer at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory 

-  Experienced observer using optical CCD photometry and near/mid-IR spectrometry; 
-  Co-I  of  ESO  Large  Programme  on  “Direct  Detections  of  the  Asteroidal  YORP  effect”  which  is 

the largest programme ever accepted at ESO in open competition; 

  Programme  is  split  into  optical  and  thermal  components:  I  have  been  undertaking  the 

thermal IR programme awarded 103 hours of category A time on VLT/VISIR 

  Developed  software  tools  using  Python  to  develop  an  efficient  procedure  to  reduce 
VLT/VISIR  thermal  IR  photometry  rapidly  and  accurately  and  to  derive  physical 
properties using thermal models and Monte Carlo trials; 

-  NASA-IRTF  SpeX  near-IR  observations  of  unbound  asteroid  pairs,  investigating  space 

weathering on fresh asteroid surfaces 

-  Palomar  and  Table  Mountain  observations  of  YORP-detection  candidates  and  unbound 

asteroid pairs 
thermal modelling of comet-asteroid transition candidates using NEOWISE data

Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute (PSSRI) at the Open University (05/2006-08/2011) 
  Solar System Observing (09/2009-08/2011):  

-  SuperWASP exoplanet survey to obtain serendipitous observations of asteroids: 

  1000s of asteroids observed optically over several years from 2007; 
  Used complex software tools to remove “blending” from background stars and account for 

a thermal offset in the camera network by using a database of standard stars; 

  Pieced  together  optical  phase  curves  and  Kaasalainen  shape  models:  307  asteroids 

observed, with 486 lightcurves produced. 

-  PhD supervisor for three students (all completed). 

 

  Project  manager  of WatSen  (06/2007-04/2010): an  ESA  contract  to  develop  a  water  sensor for a 

future Mars/asteroid/lunar mission. 
-  WatSen  is  a  compact  breadboard  prototype  ATR  spectrometer,  microscope  and  humidity 

sensor, with the OU as prime contractors; 

-  Coordinated  with  international  industrial  partners  to  deliver  instrument  under  budget  (approx. 

$400 000); 

-  For  two  years  running  was  awarded  merit  award  from  the  Science  Faculty  for  outstanding 

contribution to the WatSen project; 

-  Ran testing programme in Martian analogue environment; 
-  Wrote 140 page technical report and delivered instrument to ESA; 
-  Organised Progress Meetings and gave several presentations to ESA; 
-  Written Payload Definition documents for MarsNEXT and Marco Polo,  a  proposed Near Earth 

Asteroid (NEA) sample return mission; 

 

  Sub-contracted payload engineer for QinetiQ (pre post-doc 05/2006-06/2007): Defined the science 
payload  for  an  ESA  Phase  A  study  on  Don  Quijote,  a  proposed  impact  mitigation  preparation 
mission to an NEA. 
-  Assessed the physical properties of the target NEAs; 
-  Defined  scientific  measurement  requirements,  prioritised  and  sized  payload  (e.g.  optical,  near 

and mid-infrared, X-ray, laser altimeters, radio science); 

-  Modelled thermal properties of target NEAs to assess measurement of Yarkovsky effect; 
-  Wrote 150 page technical report which was reviewed by NEOMAP (Near-Earth Object Mission 

Advisory Panel, set-up by ESA and consisting of 6 world-leading scientists)

diameters
