  Short  abstract:  In  this  work  I  made  a  significant  contribution  in  planning,  achieving,  and  analyzing  the 
mirror-like  finish  (with  a  surface  roughness  values  in  the  range  of  10-50  nm)  on  4  inch  diameter  copper 
wafers by the ECP process for microelectronics and optical applications. Literature survey involved study 
of about 25 research publications and 15 Patents on the ECP of copper. The literature on ECP of copper has 
so far not reported mirror polishing of as large area as 4” dia. I designed a new wafer holding system and 
made several changes in the ECP system (particularly electrolyte recirculation system) through which this 
achievement was made possible. I conducted 18 sets of experiments with each set of experiments lasting 3-
4 hours. The experiments were planned systematically to study the effect of main process variables which 
include  applied  DC  voltage,  polishing  time,  electrolyte  flow  rate,  and  composition  of  electrolyte  (i.e 
concentration  of  ortho-phosphoric  acid  and  copper  sulphate  pentahydrate)  on  the  quality  of  polishing.  I 
observed  the  ECP  process  very  carefully  and  made  various  modification  in  the  ECP  setup  to  solve  the 
various  polishing  quality  related  problems  particularly  evolution  of  the  gases  during  the  process.  While 
studying  and  analyzing  the  polished  surface  I  also  gained  valuable  hands-on  experience  on  optical 
microscope, environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM), and atomic force microscope (AFM).

Ph. D.  Thesis:  "Automated Process Selection and Parametric Optimization of Advanced Machining 

Processes (AMPs)" 

 

     Thesis Supervisor: Prof. V. K. Jain (Professor, ME, IIT Kanpur) 

Short Abstract:  

This project was sponsored by the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government 
  
of India. An integrated and automated process planning system named as  APSPOAMPS (standing for 
Automated Process Selection and Parametric Optimization of AMPS) was envisaged and developed in 
this research work. 
 
  
The  requirements  like  ultra  precision  machining  of  complex  shapes,  machining  at  micro  and 
nano  levels,  surface  integrity  aspects  etc.,  have  contributed  towards  the  development  of  Advanced 
Machining Processes (AMPs). Effective, efficient and economic utilization of the capabilities of AMPs 
necessitates careful selection of a suitable process and subsequent parametric optimization. Selection of 
an appropriate AMP depends to a large extent on the knowledge and experience regarding the AMPs, 
nature of a particular application and availability of the required data. Since, experience and expertise 
transferring  from  person  to  person is  of  time  consuming,  an  interactive  computer  program  can  aid  an 
engineer in making decision regarding process selection and manufacturability.  
 

Development of an automated system for process selection:  A system like AMPSPOAMPS 
forms the core of an integrated and automated or computer aided process planning (CAPP) system for 
advanced machining environment. The conceptual details, solution methodology and decision logic of 
APOPOAMPS were implemented in the form of interactive, user-friendly and pull-down menus driven 
software.  This  software  was  developed  using  Windows  Programming  via  Application  Programming 
Interface  (API)  in  C/C++  programming  language.  The  developed  automated  system  comprises  the 
following  modules,  which  accomplish  the  various  tasks  through  different  menus  of  the  developed 
system: i) Input module (to gather the required information like physical and mechanical properties of 
work  materials,  shape  generation  requirements,  operational  requirements  etc.  by  interactive  way)  ii) 
Manufacturing  process  selection  module  (for  deciding  the  basic  nature  of  manufacturing  process 
according  to  the  requirements)  iii)  AMP  selection  and  ranking  module  [The  tasks  of  the  process 
selection  and  ranking  is  carried  out  at  five  levels,  in  which  at  first  level,  non  applicable  AMPs  are 
eliminated  according  to  the  nature  of  work  material  and  according  to  the  shape  or  feature  generation 
requirements certain AMPs are eliminated at second level, third level uses FUZZY SETS to frame the 
suitability index, and at forth and fifth levels, suitability index is framed according to the economic and 
environmental aspects respectively]. Based on these indices, user can select an appropriate process for 
parametric optimization. 
 
Parametric  optimization  by  evolutionary  computation:  Nine  optimization  models  for  six 
 
mechanical  type  AMPs  and  electro-chemical  machining  (ECM)  process  were  formulated,  after 
conducting  a  comprehensive  and  exhaustive  survey  of  the  models  of  material  removal  and  surface 
generation in these AMPs and critically examining each model. For the optimization of multi-variable 
non-linearly constrained non-linear objective functions, as encountered in formulated optimization 
models,  real-coded  genetic  algorithms  (GA)  employing  tournament  reproduction,  simulated  binary 
crossover  (SBX),  and  polynomial  mutation  were  used  for  parametric  optimization  of  AMPs.  The 
functioning and validity of the developed system was tested on a number of real-life test examples.

  M. Tech. Thesis: "Visibility Check Based Operation Planning for Axi-symmetric Components" 

 

     Thesis Supervisor: Prof. Amitabha Mukerjee (Professor, CSE, IIT Kanpur) 

Abstract: This project was sponsored by Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) Jamshedpur (India). 
It  involved  developing  an  operation  planning  software  for  axi-symmetric  components  in  computer 
aided manufacturing (CAM) environment minimizing reliance of features in the process planning. The 
developed  system  was  named  as  CARGAC  (acronym  for  Computer  Aided  Route-card  Generation  for 
Axi-symmetric Components). CARGAC uses DXF file (a neutral file format) of the CAD model of the 
product as input. It uses visibility status of a surface for determining whether a surface can be machined 
from  a  given  direction  and  subsequently  uses  the  results  of  the  visibility  status  for  identifying  and 
sequencing  the  machining  operations.  Advantages  of  visibility  based  approach  are  greater  flexibility 
and  less  dependence  on  subjective  aspects in  process  planning.  A  set  of  heuristics  was  developed for 
sequencing  the  machining  operations for  axi-symmetric  components.  CARGAC  graphically  simulates 
the  results  of  input  pre-processing  and  visibility  check,  while,  results  of  machining  operations 
identification and sequencing are written in a route card format. Entire source code for the system was 
written in Turbo C programming language and was implemented on IBM compatible PC-XT/AT.
