Design: ChucK Music Programming Language 

Chief designer and architect.  2003–present | A programming language for real-time 
sound synthesis and music creation. At the core of ChucK is a unique way of thinking 
about time and deterministic concurrency as powerful, precise mechanism for crafting 
sound and physical interactions (we call this strongly-timed). Designed for digital 
artists and musicians.  http://chuck.stanford.edu/

Design: Ocarina and Ocarina 2 

Inventor and chief designer.  Smule 2008 and 2012 | One of the original Apple Hall of 
Fame apps, Ocarina transformed the iPhone into a flute-like instrument, while offering 
a social dimension that allows its users to hear one another anonymously around the 
world. With more than 10 million downloads, Ocarina combines physical interaction 
design and social experimentation that remains a milestone mobile music application, 
serving as a window into what might be possible.  http://www.gewang.com/ocarina/

Stanford Laptop Orchestra (SLOrk) 

Founding director; designer of instruments, works, and curricula; curator of over 30 
performances.  2008–present | The Stanford Laptop Orchestra (SLOrk) is a large-scale, 
computer-mediated ensemble and instrument design laboratory that explores cutting-
edge technology in combination with conventional musical contexts – aiming to 
radically transform both. Founded in 2008 by director Ge Wang and students, faculty, 
and staff at Stanford, this unique ensemble comprises more than 20 laptops, human 
performers, controllers, and custom multi-channel speaker arrays designed to provide 
each computer meta-instrument with its own identity and presence.  Overall 100 new 
instruments and works premiered.  http://slork.stanford.edu/

Social Music Design: Leaf Trombone: World Stage  

Creator and chief designer.  Smule 2009 | An experimental social design where users 
can create musical content, perform using a mobile phone-based instrument, and 
present that performance to the greater community. As part of a social game, these 
users are then recruited to serve as juries in online, real-time judging sessions, giving 
feedback and ratings to the performers. This creates an ecosystem where a participant 
can take on the role of performer, judge, observer, and/or composer. This experiment 
was fully implemented and deployed in an iPhone application, Smule’s Leaf 
Trombone: World Stage, which has reached more than 800,000 users.

PATENTS (AWARDED AND PENDING) 

“System and Method for Capturing and Rendering of Performance on Synthetic Musical 
Instrument.”  U.S.  Patent  8222507.    With  Spencer  D.  Salazar  and  Perry  R.  Cook, 
assigned  to  Smule  2012.    Description:  Capturing  multiple  gestures  on  a  mobile  device 
(blowing  on  the  microphone,  touching  various  points  on  a  multi-touch  screen,  tilting  the 
device,  etc.),  encoding  those  gestures  (effectively  compressing  the  performance),  using  the 
gesture codes to control a synthesizer in real time, uploading the gesture codes to a server for 
later transmittal and resynthesis on another client, using uploaded gestures to render a sound 
file  (.wav,  .mp3,  etc.)  on  a  server  and  offering  playback  of  such  files  on  a  mobile  or  non-
mobile  device  (e.g.,  via  a  web  browser).    Geo-coding  the  location  of  a  performance, 
transmitting  that  information  to  a  server,  and  using  it  later  to  display  resynthesized 
performances on a globe or map (either on mobile device or other).

Yang.    Description:  Capture  of  finger  gestures  on  virtual  strings,  combined  with  finger 
gestures indicative of bowing one or more strings, using an encoding of the gesture streams to 
control a digital string instrument model for sound synthesis.  Displaying score-driven markers 
on  the  multi-touch  display  to  indicate  to  the  user  where  and  when  gestures  should  be 
performed in real-time. 

“Audiovisual  Sampling  for  Percussive-Type  Instrument  with  Crowd-sourced  Content 
Sourcing  and  Distribution.”  Patent  Filed  2012,  U.S.  Non-provisional  13/607153.

Orchestra Live in Beijing Concert at the Stanford Center @  Peking University in 
July 2014.  Sounds recorded on location in Beijing; live processing via gestures. 
“Contiuum” (2014, with Madeline Huberth) for laptop orchestra and live visuals. 

Forward motion is. 

A study in dynamics and balance; 
cyclic tendrils ebbing and flowing, swelling and retreating;  
timbres varying over pseudo-life-cycles;  
voices echoing in space and through windows into processes set in motion  
long before we are, and will continue long after;  
like ocean waves, unrelenting, not looking back.  

Forward motion is. 

“Twilight” (2013) for laptop orchestra.  Inspired by the classic science-fiction short 
story “Twilight” by John W. Campbell (published in 1934, under the pseudonym 
“Don A. Stuart”), this piece ruminates not of the dawn, ascension, nor triumph of the 
human race, but of one possible demise set seven million years in the future.  This 
end is not one of annihilation through war, nor decimation from famine or disease, 
but a golden decrescendo of defeat brought on by the gradual, peaceful, but 
unstoppable usurping of technology and machines -- and the loss of man's curiosity 
and sense of wonder.  From the original text: 
“Twilight – the sun has set.  The desert out beyond, in its mystic, changing colors.  
The great, metal city rising straight-walled to the human city above, broken by spires 
and towers and great trees with scented blossoms.  The silvery-rose glow in the 
paradise of gardens above.” 
i. The Dead City 
“And all the great city-structure throbbing and humming to the steady gentle beat of 
perfect, deathless machines built more than three million years before – and never 
touched since that time by human hands.  And they go on.  The dead city.  The men 
that have lived, and hoped, and built – and died to leave behind them those little men 
who can only wonder and look and long for a forgotten kind of companionship.  

                                                   Ge Wang | CV  19 

They wander through the vast cities their ancestors built, knowing less of them than 
the machines themselves.” 
ii. A Song of Longings 
“And the songs.  Those tell the story best, I think.  Little, hopeless, wondering men 
amid vast unknowing, blind machines that started three million years before – and 
just never knew how to stop.  They are dead – and can't die and be still.” 
This is the first installment in the Twilight series for various and mixed media.  The 
cycle explores the psychology, longing, beauty and sadness of a twilight of humanity 
ending not in a bang, but an irreversible powerdown, basked in the golden, lingering, 
dying glow of man’s dusk. 

“GG Music” (2013, with Mark Cerqueira and Spencer Salazar) for live 8-channel and 

Starcraft 2.  This piece examines the possibilities of using a popular real-time 
strategy computer game as the interface to a rich musical environment.  Two players 
go head-to-head in a competitive match of StarCraft 2, observed by a third 
performer.  As they develop economies and wage battles against each other, 
SoundCraft (a custom software created with the Starcraft 2 Editor, Ruby, and the 
ChucK audio programming language) collects gameplay data, which is extensively 
sonified in real-time. The sonification rises and falls with the development of the 
ongoing match, exploring the relationship between StarCraft’s gameplay mechanics 
and musical performance.  New Interfaces for Musical Expression 2013. 

“Converge” (2010, with Jieun Oh) for the Stanford Laptop Orchestra (SLOrk) and 

Stanford Mobile Phone Orchestra (MoPhO). Images, sounds, and sentiments from 
Jieun’s and Ge’s everyday lives are captured, time- and geo-tagged, and collected 
via iPhones and cloud-based servers; they converge during the performance in an 
audio-visual journey of memory, time, and space. 

“TBA” (2007) for the Princeton Laptop Orchestra (PLOrk) and Stanford Laptop 

Orchestra (SLOrk).  Orchestral Live Coding for 15 laptops using ChucK!  Premiered 
in Princeton. 

“Joy of Chant” (2007) for the Princeton Laptop Orchestra (PLOrk).  (with Rebecca 
Fiebrink and Perry Cook). A scored and improvisatory work for laptop ensemble, 
using joystick- and keyboard-controlled real-time singing synthesis. 

“PLOrk Beat Science” (2007, with Rebecca Fiebrink).  An Adventure for Flute and 
HyPLOrkussion!  Performances include: National Academy of Science Museum 
Washington DC, Electro-music 2007 Festival in Philadelphia, Princeton 2007, New 
Interfaces for Music Expression 2009, Pittsburgh.

“Crystalis” (2006) for the Princeton Laptop Orchestra (PLOrk) and Stanford Laptop 
Orchestra 
(SLOrk).  This is a sonic rumination of crystal caves in the clouds, where 
the only sounds are those of the wind and the resonances of the crystals.  It uses two 
simple instruments called the crystalis and wind-o-lin.  These instruments make use 
of the laptop keyboard (which controls pitch and resonance) and the trackpad (which 
the players “bow” in various patterns to generate sound).

“ChucK ChucK Rocket” (2006) (with Scott Smallwood, special thanks to Ananya 

Misra) for the Princeton Laptop Orchestra (PLOrk).  Human players perform via a 
networked game-board for virtual mouse-like critters, creating patterns at various 
scales via patterns and sound objects. 

“CliX” (2006) for the Princeton Laptop Orchestra (PLOrk) and Stanford Laptop 

Orchestra (SLOrk).  Human operators type to make sounds, while their machines 
synthesize, synchronize, and spatialize the audio.  Every key on the computer 
keyboard (upper/lower-case letters, numbers, symbols) is mapped to a distinct pitch 
(using the key's ASCII representation) and when pressed, emits a clicking sound that 
is synchronized in time to a common pulse.  A (human) conductor coordinates 
frequency range, texture, movement, and timing.

“Non-Specific Gamelan Taiko Fusion” (2005) for the Princeton Laptop Orchestra 
(PLOrk) and Stanford Laptop Orchestra (SLOrk).  (with Perry Cook) This piece is
