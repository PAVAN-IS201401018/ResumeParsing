PROJECTS 

MULTIMEDIA TRANSMISSION OVER WIRELESS   
Details 

 

 

 

 

 

 

    Nov 2010 – Present 

  Objective - Implement a video coding standard to enable transmission and unpacking at multiple spatio-temporal 

resolutions with variegated bitrates so as to make video streaming readily suited for wireless networks  
Sponsor company – BSNL India 

 
Role 

  Developed MPEG encoder with scalability feature. Generated bitstream can be decoded up to 3 spatial resolutions 

depending on the receiver requirement and bandwidth availability 

  Added RTP functionality to encoder using JRTP library so as to complete a working model of the SVC codec for video 

streaming of live events on the IITK campus wireless infrastructure 

  Platform – Linux/Windows 
  Libraries – Open CV, JRTP
