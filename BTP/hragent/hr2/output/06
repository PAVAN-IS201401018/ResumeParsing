Summary 

I have been deeply and exclusively involved in supporting and deploying enterprise 

infrastructure management and automation tools globally for nearly a decade with the HP 
automation suite - Server Automation, Operations Orchestration, Network Automation, 
Cloud Service Automation.  

Transitioning from Support to Professional Services in March 2008, I continue to solve 
complex infrastructure problems: in repair, design, and implementation; keeping multiple 
projects running with multiple customers at the same time, on time; developing and 
implementing Best Practices in DCA; contributing to internal and external knowledge base 
articles and blog posts; supporting and delivering cloud infrastructure, management, and 
automation; conducting on-site engagement/project management; acting as primary PM 
liaison; writing and delivering project and environment documentation. 

I have a diverse background across many fields – both technical and non-technical – and 
varied industries (medical devices, professional services, financial services, retail, health, non-
profits, education, etc). I am comfortable on almost any platform, and have used every major 
one excepting mainframes (Linux, FreeBSD, Haiku (and BeOS), Mac OS X, Windows (server 
and desktop), Solaris, AIX). While delivering cloud and data center automation solutions, I 
have been exposed to the VMware product line (ESXi, vCenter, vSphere), Amazon AWS, and 
other cloud and virtualization platforms. 

I have tutored, developed curriculum materials, written tutorials/how-tos, taught classes, 

provided mentoring, lead teams, and work effectively either independently or on a team.
