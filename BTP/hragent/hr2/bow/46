- co-i of eso large programme on “direct detections of the asteroidal yorp effect” which is the largest programme ever accepted at eso in open competition;  programme is split into optical and thermal components: i have been undertaking the thermal ir programme awarded 103 hours of category a time on vlt/visir  developed software tools using python to develop an efficient procedure to reduce vlt/visir thermal ir photometry rapidly and accurately and to derive physical properties using thermal models and monte carlo trials; - nasa-irtf spex near-ir observations of unbound asteroid pairs investigating space weathering on fresh asteroid surfaces - palomar and table mountain observations of yorp-detection candidates and unbound asteroid pairs thermal modelling of comet-asteroid transition candidates using neowise data - planetary and space sciences research institute (pssri) at the open university (05/2006-08/2011) solar system observing (09/2009-08/2011): - superwasp exoplanet survey to obtain serendipitous observations of asteroids:  1000s of asteroids observed optically over several years from 2007;  used complex software tools to remove “blending” from background stars and account for a thermal offset in the camera network by using a database of standard stars;  pieced together optical phase curves and kaasalainen shape models: 307 asteroids observed with 486 lightcurves produced. - phd supervisor for three students (all completed). project manager of watsen (06/2007-04/2010): an esa contract to develop a water sensor for a future mars/asteroid/lunar mission. - watsen is a compact breadboard prototype atr spectrometer microscope and humidity sensor with the ou as prime contractors; - coordinated with international industrial partners to deliver instrument under budget (approx. $400 000); - for two years running was awarded merit award from the science faculty for outstanding contribution to the watsen project; - ran testing programme in martian analogue environment; - wrote 140 page technical report and delivered instrument to esa; - organised progress meetings and gave several presentations to esa; - written payload definition documents for marsnext and marco polo a proposed near earth asteroid (nea) sample return mission; sub-contracted payload engineer for qinetiq (pre post-doc 05/2006-06/2007): defined the science payload for an esa phase a study on don quijote a proposed impact mitigation preparation mission to an nea. - assessed the physical properties of the target neas; - defined scientific measurement requirements prioritised and sized payload (e.g. optical near and mid-infrared x-ray laser altimeters radio science); - modelled thermal properties of target neas to assess measurement of yarkovsky effect; - wrote 150 page technical report which was reviewed by neomap (near-earth object mission advisory panel set-up by esa and consisting of 6 world-leading scientists) curriculum vitae: stephen d. wolters - established a network with space experts from diverse disciplines; - i have given presentations at 5 progress meetings and at the final presentation with esa. associate lecturer for the open university: - teaching course s282 astronomy to students from a wide range of backgrounds - on course team for ou course “science in context” developing new teaching material - tutor on open university residential school sxr208: observing the universe teaching practical astronomy to ou students using telescopes in majorca - series of public outreach lectures to schools and astronomy societies across the country about near-earth asteroids and the impact hazard (9 in two years) education and post-graduate research ph.d. from pssri supervised by dr. simon green defended nov. 2005 awarded 28 feb. 2007. thesis: thermal infrared and optical observations of near-earth asteroids (neas). on four observing runs (ukirt on mauna kea using michelle spectrometer and uist jkt in la palma) learnt how to acquire complex technical skills quickly and work under pressure. some important results: increased number of neas with measured diameters by 10% - - developed a new thermal model simulating emission from the night side of an asteroid and significantly improving accuracy of old standard model self-motivated to manage a complex research project over several years. astronomical observations reduction and analysis experience: - used ccd photometry software to reduce optical photometry deriving composite lightcurves of neas with fourier analysis - wrote programs to fit thermal models to the ir spectra to determine nea albedos and diameters attended several conferences becoming proficient at creating concise presentations: - one of 20 students across europe sponsored by the european space agency (esa) to give an oral presentation at the committee on space research (cospar) in paris june 2004 degree: m.sci. physics with space science at university college london (1997-2001 class: 2:1) 4th year project: investigating magnetic reconnection in solar flares at the mullard space science laboratory (mssl) 2nd year project developing code for the refraction grating spectrometer (rgs) on the x-ray maximum mission (xmm) at mssl. secondary and sixth form school: winchester college a-level: physics (a) mathematics (a) biology (a) additional skills project management workshop formalised skills acquired from several years project management of watsen part of astrium team for entry into planetary societys apophis mission design competition consulted on science and payload refereed several papers for peer-reviewed journals and reviewed standard grant applications for funding council programming: iraf java c++ idl fortran90;
