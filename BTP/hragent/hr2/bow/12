13 theses/projects: boyscast fellowship project: “electrochemical polishing (ecp) of copper discs ” supervisor: prof. ranga komanduri regents professor mechanical and aerospace engineering college of engineering architecture and technology 218 engineering north oklahoma state university stillwater ok-74075 (usa)  short abstract: in this work i made a significant contribution in planning achieving and analyzing the mirror-like finish (with a surface roughness values in the range of 10-50 nm) on 4 inch diameter copper wafers by the ecp process for microelectronics and optical applications. literature survey involved study of about 25 research publications and 15 patents on the ecp of copper. the literature on ecp of copper has so far not reported mirror polishing of as large area as 4” dia. i designed a new wafer holding system and made several changes in the ecp system (particularly electrolyte recirculation system) through which this achievement was made possible. i conducted 18 sets of experiments with each set of experiments lasting 3- 4 hours. the experiments were planned systematically to study the effect of main process variables which include applied dc voltage polishing time electrolyte flow rate and composition of electrolyte (i.e concentration of ortho-phosphoric acid and copper sulphate pentahydrate) on the quality of polishing. i observed the ecp process very carefully and made various modification in the ecp setup to solve the various polishing quality related problems particularly evolution of the gases during the process. while studying and analyzing the polished surface i also gained valuable hands-on experience on optical microscope environmental scanning electron microscope (esem) and atomic force microscope (afm). 14 ph. d. thesis: "automated process selection and parametric optimization of advanced machining processes (amps)" thesis supervisor: prof. v. k. jain (professor me iit kanpur) short abstract: this project was sponsored by the department of science and technology (dst) government of india. an integrated and automated process planning system named as apspoamps (standing for automated process selection and parametric optimization of amps) was envisaged and developed in this research work. the requirements like ultra precision machining of complex shapes machining at micro and nano levels surface integrity aspects etc. have contributed towards the development of advanced machining processes (amps). effective efficient and economic utilization of the capabilities of amps necessitates careful selection of a suitable process and subsequent parametric optimization. selection of an appropriate amp depends to a large extent on the knowledge and experience regarding the amps nature of a particular application and availability of the required data. since experience and expertise transferring from person to person is of time consuming an interactive computer program can aid an engineer in making decision regarding process selection and manufacturability. development of an automated system for process selection: a system like ampspoamps forms the core of an integrated and automated or computer aided process planning (capp) system for advanced machining environment. the conceptual details solution methodology and decision logic of apopoamps were implemented in the form of interactive user-friendly and pull-down menus driven software. this software was developed using windows programming via application programming interface (api) in c/c++ programming language. the developed automated system comprises the following modules which accomplish the various tasks through different menus of the developed system: i) input module (to gather the required information like physical and mechanical properties of work materials shape generation requirements operational requirements etc. by interactive way) ii) manufacturing process selection module (for deciding the basic nature of manufacturing process according to the requirements) iii) amp selection and ranking module [the tasks of the process selection and ranking is carried out at five levels in which at first level non applicable amps are eliminated according to the nature of work material and according to the shape or feature generation requirements certain amps are eliminated at second level third level uses fuzzy sets to frame the suitability index and at forth and fifth levels suitability index is framed according to the economic and environmental aspects respectively]. based on these indices user can select an appropriate process for parametric optimization. parametric optimization by evolutionary computation: nine optimization models for six mechanical type amps and electro-chemical machining (ecm) process were formulated after conducting a comprehensive and exhaustive survey of the models of material removal and surface generation in these amps and critically examining each model. for the optimization of multi-variable non-linearly constrained non-linear objective functions as encountered in formulated optimization models real-coded genetic algorithms (ga) employing tournament reproduction simulated binary crossover (sbx) and polynomial mutation were used for parametric optimization of amps. the functioning and validity of the developed system was tested on a number of real-life test examples. 15 m. tech. thesis: "visibility check based operation planning for axi-symmetric components" thesis supervisor: prof. amitabha mukerjee (professor cse iit kanpur) abstract: this project was sponsored by tata iron and steel company (tisco) jamshedpur (india). it involved developing an operation planning software for axi-symmetric components in computer aided manufacturing (cam) environment minimizing reliance of features in the process planning. the developed system was named as cargac (acronym for computer aided route-card generation for axi-symmetric components). cargac uses dxf file (a neutral file format) of the cad model of the product as input. it uses visibility status of a surface for determining whether a surface can be machined from a given direction and subsequently uses the results of the visibility status for identifying and sequencing the machining operations. advantages of visibility based approach are greater flexibility and less dependence on subjective aspects in process planning. a set of heuristics was developed for sequencing the machining operations for axi-symmetric components. cargac graphically simulates the results of input pre-processing and visibility check while results of machining operations identification and sequencing are written in a route card format. entire source code for the system was written in turbo c programming language and was implemented on ibm compatible pc-xt/at. b.e. project: "process planning and part programming for the manufacture of typical component on nc and cnc machines" project
