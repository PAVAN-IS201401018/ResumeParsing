live processing via gestures. “contiuum” (2014 with madeline huberth) for laptop orchestra and live visuals. forward motion is. a study in dynamics and balance; cyclic tendrils ebbing and flowing swelling and retreating; timbres varying over pseudo-life-cycles; voices echoing in space and through windows into processes set in motion long before we are and will continue long after; like ocean waves unrelenting not looking back. forward motion is. “twilight” (2013) for laptop orchestra. inspired by the classic science-fiction short story “twilight” by john w. campbell (published in 1934 under the pseudonym “don a. stuart”) this piece ruminates not of the dawn ascension nor triumph of the human race but of one possible demise set seven million years in the future. this end is not one of annihilation through war nor decimation from famine or disease but a golden decrescendo of defeat brought on by the gradual peaceful but unstoppable usurping of technology and machines -- and the loss of man's curiosity and sense of wonder. from the original text: “twilight - the sun has set. the desert out beyond in its mystic changing colors. the great metal city rising straight-walled to the human city above broken by spires and towers and great trees with scented blossoms. the silvery-rose glow in the paradise of gardens above.” i. the dead city “and all the great city-structure throbbing and humming to the steady gentle beat of perfect deathless machines built more than three million years before - and never touched since that time by human hands. and they go on. the dead city. the men that have lived and hoped and built - and died to leave behind them those little men who can only wonder and look and long for a forgotten kind of companionship. ge wang | cv 19 they wander through the vast cities their ancestors built knowing less of them than the machines themselves.” ii. a song of longings “and the songs. those tell the story best i think. little hopeless wondering men amid vast unknowing blind machines that started three million years before - and just never knew how to stop. they are dead - and can't die and be still.” this is the first installment in the twilight series for various and mixed media. the cycle explores the psychology longing beauty and sadness of a twilight of humanity ending not in a bang but an irreversible powerdown basked in the golden lingering dying glow of mans dusk. “gg music” (2013 with mark cerqueira and spencer salazar) for live 8-channel and starcraft 2. this piece examines the possibilities of using a popular real-time strategy computer game as the interface to a rich musical environment. two players go head-to-head in a competitive match of starcraft 2 observed by a third performer. as they develop economies and wage battles against each other soundcraft (a custom software created with the starcraft 2 editor ruby and the chuck audio programming language) collects gameplay data which is extensively sonified in real-time. the sonification rises and falls with the development of the ongoing match exploring the relationship between starcrafts gameplay mechanics and musical performance. new interfaces for musical expression 2013. “converge” (2010 with jieun oh) for the stanford laptop orchestra (slork) and stanford mobile phone orchestra (mopho). images sounds and sentiments from jieuns and ges everyday lives are captured time- and geo-tagged and collected via iphones and cloud-based servers; they converge during the performance in an audio-visual journey of memory time and space. “tba” (2007) for the princeton laptop orchestra (plork) and stanford laptop orchestra (slork). orchestral live coding for 15 laptops using chuck! premiered in princeton. “joy of chant” (2007) for the princeton laptop orchestra (plork).
